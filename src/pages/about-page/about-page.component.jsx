            <h1>A bit about me...</h1>
            <p>
                I am a software developer focused mainly on web technologies. I currently reside in the
                Austin, Texas area and could not love it more! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a highly diverse career background - driven mainly by my desire to learn new things,
                and apply them to the world around me. I graduated high school with an Emergency Medical Technician
                (EMT) license and worked on an ambulance and in a local ER while I attended Texas State University in
                San Marcos. There my studies were focused primarily around human health in various forms, with a major
                in psychology and dual minors in biology and biochemistry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was these studies that I have to thank for my current passion; in school I learned that the body
                functions like one giant machine, supplemented with billions of smaller machines. After school out of curiosity or fate
                I discovered programming, and the concept of abstraction and everything clicked! I was able to build beautiful, interesting,
                and useful things based on the genius of my CS predecessors and I have not stopped yet! 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am in need of a 'tech detox' I absolutely love to go camping. I will venture out alone at times, but of course 
                the best times are had with my wife and our two dogs. I am also a budding runner / biker and have some aspirations to complete 
                a triathlon someday. I also love going out and exploring my city, and juist finding interesting things to do. 
            </p>

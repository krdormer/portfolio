            <h1>A bit about me...</h1>
            <p>
                I am a software developer focused mainly on web technologies. I currently reside in the
                Austin, Texas area and could not love it more! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a highly diverse background - driven mainly by my desire to learn new things,
                and apply them to the world around me. In graduated high school with an Emergency Medical Technician
                (EMT) license and worked on an ambulance and in a local ER while I attended Texas State University in
                San Marcos. There my studies were focused primarily around human health in various forms, with a major
                in psychology and dual minors in biology and biochemistry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was these studies that I have to thank for my current passion; in school I learned that the body
                functions like one giant machine, supplemented with billions of smaller machines
